# Hello world

To print a string to the console you can use the `println` function from the `io` module.

```ts
import "io"

io.println("Hello world with Sunbird!")
```

This will print `Hello world with Sunbird!` to the console.

You can also use `print` function to print a string to the console without a newline.

```ts
import "io"

io.print("Hello world with Sunbird!")
```

To learn more about the io module see the [io](../std/io.md) module docs.
